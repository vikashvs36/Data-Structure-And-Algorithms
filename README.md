# Data-Structure-And-Algorithms
A data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can 
be applied to the data

There are two types of data structure:
* Linear Data Structure
* Non-linear Data Structure

## Linear Data Structure
Data structure where data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly where the elements are attached to its previous
and next adjacent in what is called a linear data structure. In linear data structure, single level is involved. 
Therefore, we can traverse all the elements in single run only.

* Array
* Stack
* Queue
* Linked-List

## Non-Linear Data Structure
Data structures where data elements are not arranged sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures.

* Graphs
* Trees

## Stack
Stack is a linear data structure. Insertion and Deletion are performed by one end that is called top. The order may be 
LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out). **push** adds an item to the top of the stack, **pop** removes the 
item from the top.

> **Implementation:**

There are two ways to implement a stack:

* Using array
* Using linked list
