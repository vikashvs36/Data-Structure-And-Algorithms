## Stack
Stack is a linear data structure. Insertion and Deletion are performed by one end that is called top. The order may be 
LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out). **push** adds an item to the top of the stack, **pop** removes the 
item from the top.

> **Implementation:**

There are two ways to implement a stack:

* Using array
* Using linked list
